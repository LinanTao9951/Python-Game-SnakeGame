Classic snake game, written in a way of OOP, forked from Dr. Angela Yu, Day 20 in "100 days of code" course.

A great thanks to Dr. Angela Yu for her teaching in Udemy online course.

Targets achieved:
1. Use the turtle module to move a snake, place a food and show the score.
2. Create a class 'Snake' to create, move, turn direction.
3. Create a class 'Food' to place a food on the screen.
4. Create a class 'Score' to record player's current scores.
5. Use arrow keys to control the snake.
6. If the snake hits the food, place a food in another position and increase user score by 1.  

Problems solved:
1. Create a snake body: initial length = 3 squares
2. Move a snake: Move snake from tail to head. Turn head only when changing direction.
3. Create snake food
4. Detect collision with food
5. Create a score board
6. Detect collison with wall
7. Detect collision with tail
